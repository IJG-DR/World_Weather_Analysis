# World Weather Analysis

This assignment consists of three technical analyses with the following deliverables:

## Deliverable 1: Retrieve Weather Data

Generate a set of 2,000 random latitudes and longitudes, retrieve the nearest city, and perform an API call with the *OpenWeatherMap*. In addition to the city weather data gathered in this module, use API skills to retrieve the current weather description for each city. Then, create a new DataFrame containing the updated weather data. Export the DataFrame as a CSV file, and save it as *WeatherPy_Database.csv* in the *Weather_Database* folder.

## Deliverable 2: Create a Customer Travel Destinations Map

Use input statements to retrieve customer weather preferences, then use those preferences to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. Create an output file to store the hotels DataFrame as *WeatherPy_vacation.csv* in the *Vacation_Search* folder. Then, show those destinations on a marker layer map with pop-up markers. Save a screenshot of the map in the *Vacation_Search* folder as *WeatherPy_vacation_map.png*.


## Deliverable 3: Create a Travel Itinerary Map

Use the Google Directions API to create a travel itinerary that shows the route between four cities chosen from the customerâ€™s possible travel destinations. Save a screenshot of the map to the *Vacation_Itinerary* folder as *WeatherPy_travel_map.png*.

Then, create a marker layer map with a pop-up marker for each city on the itinerary. Save a screenshot of the map to the *Vacation_Itinerary* folder as *WeatherPy_travel_map_markers.png*.
